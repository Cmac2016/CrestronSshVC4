# CrestronSshVC4

Basic Example of using a custom SSH server on Crestron VC-4.
The sample has a basic implementation of how to use the FxSsh Library.

You can add commands that you want to utilize to the collection than process data based on console request.
The sample also includes a method to send custom data back tot he console if needed.

This is a very basic example.
